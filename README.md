## Close Source Info
> We originally planned MClient++ to be ```Open Sourced``` but due to the fact that alot of people telling me they will skid MClient++
i decided to make this closed sourced, this did affect our playerbase as ```AntiVirus Softwares will flag it as a virus``` because it thinks that we are hiding something dangerous because we encrypted MClient++, MClient++ is 100% safe. we have over 17k downloads to confirm
